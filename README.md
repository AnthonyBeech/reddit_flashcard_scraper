# reddit_flashcard_scraper

By scraping comments from subreddits in other languages, the script can generate flash cards with example sentences in both the target language and english.

Lematisation is used to ensure that words such as andiammo or andevo are converted to the infintive form andare, so that the word frequency is more accurate.

The translation API is pretty inaccurate but once the google api is working again, I can update.

Supported languages are Spanish, Italian and Turkish
